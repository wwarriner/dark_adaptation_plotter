# Dark Adaptation Plotter

A GUI specifically designed for plotting dark adaptation data.

## Background

In degenerative diseases of the retina, including [age-related macular degeneration (AMD)](https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/age-related-macular-degeneration), visual acuity and sensitivity decrease over time as the retinal tissue dies. One measurement of disease progression is [dark adapation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptation_(eye)). Dark adaptation is the eye's process of adjusting to a dark environment after exposure to a bright light.

Dark adaptation can be measured using a specialized device. The device exposes the user to a uniform bright light of known intensity, which is then removed. Periodically the device supplies a flash of light of low intensity. The flash is repeated rapidly, gradually increasing in brightness until the patient indicates they are able to see it. The intensity of the "I saw it" flash is recorded, and the process is repeated some time later.

The measurement of dark adapatation recover is typically the length of time until the patient is able to see flashes with 0.1% (-30 dB) original bright light exposure intensity.
